# 🔍 Master's Degree at DSTI Paris
 *Current – 2024/2025*  

After completing my **Cybersecurity Bachelor's** at Howest and an internship at **Apside** in Paris, I decided to pursue a Master’s degree in **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** at the **Data ScienceTech Institute (DSTI)** in Paris.

### Why This Path?
I have been passionate about cybersecurity for many years, particularly in the **analysis side** of the field. Rather than creating new systems, I enjoy **studying existing systems**, understanding how their components work together, and exploring ways to **improve or challenge them**. This curiosity drives my interest in:

* Reverse engineering
* Digital forensics
* Malware analysis
* Penetration testing

To further develop these skills, I try to engage with **online challenges** such as root-me or hackthebox, which help me apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.

+++ Program Focus
My studies at DSTI revolve around:

* Advanced cybersecurity practices
* Cloud computing and secure architecture
* Low-level software engineering and system internals
* Cryptography and secure coding
* Enterprise IT governance and risk management

+++ Classes I’ve completed include:
- IT Project Management: Traditional and Agile Approaches
- Big Data Ecosystem
- Fundamentals of Cybersecurity Practices
- Cloud Computing – Amazon AWS
- Low-Level Software Engineering
- Operating Systems (Windows & Linux)
- Preparation for Cisco CCNA
- Practical Cryptography
- Securing Databases
- Safe Behaviour Awareness (GRC & Social Engineering)

+++ Ongoing preparation for certifications includes:

* Microsoft SC-100
* CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)
* CCNA

# 🛡️ Notable Experiences

==- Reverse Engineering Challenge – Apside
**Spring 2024**  

*Worked in a team to reverse engineer compiled code and uncover hidden behavior.*  
**Skills Developed:** Systematic analysis workflows, professional reverse engineering tools, pressure-tested problem-solving, dual attacker-developer perspective.


===
==- MITRE ATT&CK Workshop – Brussels
**May 2024**  

*Engaged with the European cybersecurity community to explore detection, prevention, and incident response techniques using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.*

===

==- Quantum Computing Masterclass – IBM
**June 2024**  

*Explored quantum computing fundamentals with Qiskit and real IBM quantum processors.*  
**Why Quantum Matters:** Preparing for future threats to encryption and understanding the direction of emerging technology. My approach is gradual, focusing on the deep and challenging aspects of quantum computing.

===
==- Web Security Project – Skövde, Sweden
**February 2023**  

*Performed vulnerability assessments on intentionally outdated servers in a live, attack-and-defend environment.*  
**Key Takeaways:** Even small oversights, like default passwords, can compromise entire systems. Structured review sessions would improve future editions.
