# 🔍 Master's Degree at DSTI Paris
 === *Current – 2024/2025*
After completing my Cybersecurity Bachelor's at Howest and a rewarding internship at Apside in Paris, I decided to pursue a Master’s degree in **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** at the **Data ScienceTech Institute (DSTI)** in Paris.

### Why This Path?

Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly powered by data science and AI. From anomaly detection to automated threat response, modern security relies on advanced analytics and intelligent systems.

### Program Focus

My studies at DSTI revolve around:

* **Machine Learning for Security** – Building models for threat and anomaly detection
* **Data Analysis** – Working with large-scale security datasets
* **AI Systems** – Exploring both defensive applications and AI-related vulnerabilities
* **Big Data Technologies** – Securing and managing massive infrastructures

### Bridging Two Worlds

This program helps me combine traditional cybersecurity expertise with cutting-edge data science. It’s a powerful mix—security provides context, and data science provides the tools to tackle modern threats at scale.

==- 🛡️ Web Security Project in Skövde, Sweden

**February 2024**

In Skövde, Sweden, I took part in an intensive project week organized by the University of Skövde's Network and Systems Administration group. Students from Howest and Skövde collaborated under the guidance of professionals like Joakim Kävrestad (Swedish police digital forensics expert) and Nico Declerck (senior network administrator).

### Technical Challenges

We performed vulnerability assessments on intentionally outdated servers, which pushed us beyond modern exploits and into older technologies. The project took place in a live environment where teams had to attack and defend simultaneously.

### Key Takeaways

No major vulnerabilities emerged, but the experience highlighted how basic oversights—like default passwords—can compromise entire systems.

While the hands-on aspect was excellent, the lack of structured reviews made it harder to track missed vulnerabilities. Including dedicated review sessions in future editions would greatly improve the learning experience.

==- 🧩 Reverse Engineering Challenge at Apside

**Spring 2024**

During my internship in Paris, I discovered the INA reverse engineering challenge through Apside’s cybersecurity lead. It was an ideal opportunity to test and sharpen my technical capabilities.

### The Experience

I teamed up with another intern to tackle the challenge. Reverse engineering demands precision—understanding compiled code, uncovering logic, and identifying hidden behavior without access to the source code.

### Skills Developed

This challenge helped me:

* Build systematic analysis workflows
* Gain proficiency with professional reverse engineering tools
* Work effectively under pressure
* Think like both an attacker and a developer

It reinforced that reverse engineering is as much about patience and methodical thinking as it is about technical skill.

==- 🧭 MITRE ATT&CK Workshop – Brussels

**May 17, 2024**

I attended the 12th EU MITRE ATT&CK Community Workshop in Brussels, hosted by the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB). The event gathered professionals and enthusiasts for a day of learning and knowledge-sharing.

### About MITRE ATT&CK

MITRE ATT&CK is a globally recognized framework that documents real-world adversary tactics and techniques. It’s a crucial resource for detection, prevention, and incident response.

### Workshop Highlights

Lightning talks covered:

* Prevention strategies
* Detection and threat hunting
* Incident response approaches
* Integrations with various security tools

### Professional Impact

The workshop connected me with the European cybersecurity community and gave me practical insights into how ATT&CK is applied in real enterprise environments. Seeing how practitioners use the framework day-to-day was especially valuable.

==- ⚛️ Quantum Computing Masterclass with IBM

**June 2024**

From June 5–7, I participated in the **IBM Quantum Challenge 2024**, exploring quantum computing through IBM’s Qiskit framework.

### Why Quantum Matters to Cybersecurity

Quantum computing represents both innovation and risk. It could revolutionize computation—but also threatens modern encryption. Understanding quantum fundamentals is essential for preparing future-proof security systems.

### Learning Experience

The masterclass explored:

* Quantum mechanics foundations
* Qubits, gates, and circuit design
* Quantum algorithms
* Executing code on actual IBM quantum processors

### Perspective Gained

Working with Qiskit and real quantum hardware was eye-opening. While current quantum computers aren’t yet a threat to encryption, understanding the direction of the field is crucial. Staying ahead of emerging tech is far better than reacting later.
