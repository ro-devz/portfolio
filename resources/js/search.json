Students from Howest and Skövde collaborated under the guidance of professionals like Joakim Kävrestad (Swedish police digital forensics expert) and Nico Declerck (senior network administrator).","We performed vulnerability assessments on intentionally outdated servers, which pushed us beyond modern exploits and into older technologies. The project took place in a live environment where teams had to attack and defend simultaneously.","No major vulnerabilities emerged, but the experience highlighted how basic oversights—like default passwords—can compromise entire systems.","While the hands-on aspect was excellent, the lack of structured reviews made it harder to track missed vulnerabilities.
